# Code-Refactoring-Examples

This repository contains examples of code that has been refactored to improve readability and maintainability. Each example includes the original "bad" code, the refactored "clean" code, and tests to ensure that the functionality remains the same.

## Directory Structure

Each example is contained in its own top-level directory. Within each example directory, there are subdirectories for the "bad code" and "clean code".

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an example of code that you have refactored and would like to share or if you have any improvements or suggestions for the current examples in this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request.
